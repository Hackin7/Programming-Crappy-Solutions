# DIY Tagging system

This is a tagging and labelling system currently in use in [Exam Snippets](http://exam-snippets.herokuapp.com)

It uses vanilla javascript.

## Usage

To use in your project, copy over the 3 files
1. `index.html` or `index-bootstrap.html` if you like bootstrap
  1. Also copy over `style.css` if you want the styling
2. `tagsystem.js`
3. `ExcelToJson.py`
  1. Use this to convert a `.xlsx` file (example given in `input.xlsx`) to `data.js`. Leave `data.js` in the same directory as the other files

You can customise the files however you want to fit the demands of your project
