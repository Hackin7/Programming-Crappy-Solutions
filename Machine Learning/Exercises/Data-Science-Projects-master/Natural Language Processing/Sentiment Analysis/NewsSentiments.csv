  Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
  analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
  handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
  crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
  in the futures markets.
      Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
  be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
  corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
  deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
      Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
  sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
      With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
  traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
  rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
  soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
  attractive under normal circumstances.
      An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
  limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
  means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
  more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
  traders said.
      Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
  shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
  more attractive deal from the government, they added.
      Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
  months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
  put soybean land back into cotton.
      One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
  production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
  traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
  which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

  &lt;British Columbia
  Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
  operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
  five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
  four year term.
      The company said the credit facility is extendable under
  certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
  mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
  and completion of formal documentation.
      It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
  rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
      B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
  preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
  suspended.
      However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
  dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
  trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
      Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
  the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
  shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
  shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
      If future dividends are not declared after the April
  exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
  depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
  Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
      The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
  operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
  four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
  Columbia.
      B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
  gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
      B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
  writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
  sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
  Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
  company said.
      The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
  Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
  exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
      It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
  from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes

  billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
  while loans to companies rose seven pct.

  156.7 mln, Luckey said.
      Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in

79,"TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986
  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
  deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
  steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
  Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
  Organisation said.
      He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
  economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
      Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
  drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
  wholesale index last year.
      This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the
  economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.
      Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
  which is central to the government's economic planning, said
  Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
  shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
      ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to
  sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
  over the last five years,"" he added.
      His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
  Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
  would look better if inflation were lower and the current
  account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
      ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
  investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
  percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
  improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.
      Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
  also to blame for the high deficits.
      Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
  eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
  borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
      ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
  investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he
  said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
  requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
  5.6 pct in 1986.
      More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
  targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
  exports, and production incentives were being considered.
      ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
  into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
  policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
  local private capital come more into play as far as
  manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.
      He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
  economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
  way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
  policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
  in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
  currency is only partially convertible.

  prevailing market prices.
      ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
  We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said.
      Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of

  from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
  Department consent decree.
      Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
  shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
  counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
  was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
      Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
  merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
  burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
      Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
  reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
  or three pct.
      Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
  the units named in the consent decree.
      It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
  its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
  live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary
  damages it did not name.
      Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
  interests of shareholders of both companies.

99,"USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID
  USAir Group Inc said its board has
  rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
  52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
  best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
      The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
  Icahn-led TWA was ""highly conditional.""
      USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
  &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
  acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
  remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
  about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
  USAir common during a period just before the merger.
      The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
  arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
  hope to reach one very shortly.
      USAir said ""In light of the highly conditional nature and
  other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
  circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
  that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
  Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
      ""TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
  Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
  of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
  most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
  passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
  his own personal interests.""
      USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
  appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
  last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
  of Piedmont.
      The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
  obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
  issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the ""fair
  price"" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
  the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

  hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
  Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian

      If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
  worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
  a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
  loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
      The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was

      The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that

  its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets
  that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank
  base lending rates, market sources said.
      Until the end of last week, the central was holding out
  staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an
  apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around
  the time of the government's annual Budget on March 17.
      Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its
  close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.

154,"UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT
  A half point cut in base lending rates
  was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the
  Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of
  downward pressure, dealers said.
      During its routine intervention in the market, the bank
  trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by
  half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing
  banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.
      The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by
  surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen
  hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.
         For some time, fundamentals have
  led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending
  rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow
  wholesale money market rates down.
      Although political considerations -- the government's wish
  to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had
  been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's
  delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling
  and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the
  Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers
  said.
      In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,
  leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.
      Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the
  day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to
  10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at
  10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between
  5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.
      Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at
  around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the
  end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some
  11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated
  300 mln stg shortage.

  Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the

      Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude
  from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would

  and an Argentine firm.
      President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that

  for four months due to the quake.
      Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of
  Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government
  revenues.
      Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador
  would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to
  meet its needs until the line was repaired.
      The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio
  Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five
  mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a
  180-day period.

  the council of ministers approved

      The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo
  hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders
  assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela
  (pdvsa).
      Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half

  undisclosed sum.
      Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela
  would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a
  new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and
  champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp &lt;unp>.
      The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin's
  refinery and distribution network.
      The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures
  by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some
  400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports.

  An 11-day-old strike by

      They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed
  but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by
  Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been
  disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.
      A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant
  Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two
  weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source
  added.
      By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags
  behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped
  during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,
  the sources said.
      Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags
  a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and
  not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee
  will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

  Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000

  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
      He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
  visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister
  Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
  August.
      Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
  offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by
  earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
  was put out of action.
      Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
  is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
  allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
  pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
      Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
  shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this

      The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by

  Construction workers today began building
  a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields
  to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
  be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
  officials said.
      They said it would take about two months and at least 15
  mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
  Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
  pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
  Pacific Ocean coast.
      The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
  transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
  Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
      The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
  Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
  17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
  energy ministry official said.
      The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
  boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
  demand.
      The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
  resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
  earthquake the night before.
      The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle
  oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
  Ocean.
      Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the

195,"VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL
  Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5
  mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments
  and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines
  Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
  Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
      Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a
  total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export
  commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude
  and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
       Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
  exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
  would take an estimated five  months.
      Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for
  refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would
  repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
      Both countries are the only Latin American members of the
  Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
      Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the
  earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output
  was around 260,000 bpd.

  Saudi Arabia has lifted the
  condition it imposed on the sale of oil to Brazil and will
  accept Banco do Brasil's credit guarantees, state-oil company
  Petrobras said in a statement.
      Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
  the Saudis yesterday, after they refused to accept a letter of
  credit from the Bank of Brazil, demanding guarantees from
  leading international banks.
      It advised the Saudis the company would negotiate oil
  purchases elsewhere unless they changed their mind by Monday.
      The 2.2 mln barrels shipment will be made by the Saudis on
  March 24 as scheduled, the statement said.
      Under a 125,000 bpd contract signed in February the Saudis
  agreed to supply oil to Brazil until June.

200,"BAHIA COCOA REVIEW
  Showers continued throughout the week in
  the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
  January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
  although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
      The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
      Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
  of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
  mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
  that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
  arrivals figures.
      Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
  much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
  practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
  around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
  middlemen, exporters and processors.
      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
  obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
      Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
  cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
      Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
  only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
  1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
      New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
  June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
  under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
  per tonne FOB.
      Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
  4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
      April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
  at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
  2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
  2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
      Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
  Uruguay and open ports.
      Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
  March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
  New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
      Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
  currency areas.
      Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
  and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
  York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
  Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
  said.
      Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
  against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
  crop.
      Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
  be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
  carnival which ends midday on February 27.

      Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
  over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
  mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
      ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
  bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
  announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
      ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
  ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
  scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
  announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
  certain when it would be ready. 
      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
  between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
      ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
  analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
  doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
      Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
  offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
  could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
  acquired by Waste Management.
      Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
  ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
  examples of companies that could be interested.
      ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
  company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
  herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
  wastes.
      Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
  another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
  residential and commercial distribution system.
      Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
  catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
  the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
      Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
  fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
  the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
      Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
  individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

222,"U.S. SUGAR IMPORTS DOWN IN WEEK - USDA
  Sugar imports subject to the U.S.
  sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial
  week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons
  versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture
  Department said.
      The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year
  (January-December) has been set at 1,001,430 short tons
  compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was
  extended three months to December 31.
      The department said the Customs Service has reported that
  weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight

223,"BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY
  inflation
  plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
  economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
  prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
      Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
  value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
  indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
  pct inflation rate.
      But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
      ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
  inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank
  economist said.
      The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
  dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
  1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
  cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
  foreign debt.
      For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
  target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
  billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
  increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
  plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
  under 150 mln.

  U.S. bank discount window borrowings
  less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
  Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
      The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
  mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
  at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
  statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
  mln dlrs.
      Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
  25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
  644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
      A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
  there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
  projections in the week to Wednesday.
      He said that natural float had been ""acting a bit
  strangely"" for this time of year, noting that there had been
  poor weather during the latest week.
      The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
  mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
  nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
      The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
  float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
  float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
  two widely separated Fed districts.
      For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
  adjustments were ""small,"" adding that they fell to a negative
  750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
  unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
  country.
      The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
  different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
  and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
  2100 EST on both days.
      However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
  both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
  impact.
      During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
  window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
  by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
  institutions.
      On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
  the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
  15 pct by the smallest banks.
      The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
  reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
  Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
  deficit for the week as a whole.
      For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
  excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
  the smallest banks.

261,"AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF
  American Express Co remained silent on
  market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
  considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
  value of its stock.
      American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
  market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
  good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
  Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
  services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
      American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
  72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
      American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
  stock activity.
      Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
  meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
  yesterday of management changes.
      At the meeting, company officials said American Express
  stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
  of Shearson, according to analysts.
      Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
  operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
  president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
  positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
      Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
  sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
  spinoff.
      Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
  Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
  American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
  year.
      ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
  going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
  He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
  profitable securities firm.""
      Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
  cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
  asset.
      But others believe the company could very well of
  considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
  rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
      Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
  believes American Express could have considered a partial
  spinoff in the past.
      ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
  big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
  the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
  probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
  capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.
      Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
  it plans to expand globally.
      ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
  capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
  enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
  road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
      ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
  in the future, which goes heavily into the international
  arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and
  divestitures along the way,"" he said.
      Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
  brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
  better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
  services business.
      ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
  to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
  higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
  the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
       Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
  operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

276,"GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH
  A study on grain certificates due out
  shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
  that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
  cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
      Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
  Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
  that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
  told Reuters.
      GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
  request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
  senate agriculture committee.
      The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
  compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
      The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
  the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
      If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
  entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
  the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
  certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
  decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
      GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
  program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
      But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire
  against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
  in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.
      The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
  while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

  OPEC may be forced to meet before a
  scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
  agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
  in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
      ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
  as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
  the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
  Research Associates, CERA.
      Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
  faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
      ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
  issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
  analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
      He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
  ability to keep production under control have given way to a
  pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
  it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
      But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
  emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
  above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
      ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
  deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
  regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
  on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to
  teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
      David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
  to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
  not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
      ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
  winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
  when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
      But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
  than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
      Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
  OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
      ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
  since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard
  Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
      But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
  and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
  has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
  prompted excesses in its production.
      ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
  and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
  are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
  demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a
  telephone interview.

295,"LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987
  Liquefied natural gas imports from
  Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
  economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
      Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
  state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
  Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
      ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
  the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
  the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
  analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
      Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
  customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
  of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
  told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
  Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
      Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
  feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
  made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
  profitably even in the current price environment,""  Frank
  Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
     Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
  on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
  higher by the end of 1987.
      A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
  Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
  prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
     In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
  supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
      Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
      Company sources also said that any negotiations with
  Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
  volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
  values.

296,"SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS
  Switzerland's economy, combining low
  unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
  surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
  future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, OECD, said.
      This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
  said.
      The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
  inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
  growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
  last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
  increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
  unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
  nation OECD area.
      Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
  the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
  rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
  respectively in 1986.
      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
  year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
  would shrink in both years.
      But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
  GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
  improving international balances,"" the OECD said.
      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
  buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
  years of relative weakness, it noted.
      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
  to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
  GDP, it added.
      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
  bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
  in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
      As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
  after vigorous growth in 1986.
      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
  tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
  earners of foreign exchange.
      The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
  lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
      Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in
  international financial markets give rise to the question
  whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
  flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
  required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.

297,"U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
  actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
  Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
  officials said.
      However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
  been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
  the very near future.
      ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,""
  an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there
  just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""
      Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
  than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
  Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
  when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
  this week.
      But administration and private sources agreed that if the
  Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
  Moscow, it could take several months.
      ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
  interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.
      ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,""
  said one former USDA official, who noted that the
  administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
  China wheat under the subsidy program.
      An official representing a large grain trade company said
  deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
  Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
  subsidy offer to the Soviets.
      But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
  Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
  secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
      The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
  comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
  clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
  at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
      In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
  administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
  new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
  consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm,
  basic, factual economics.""
      Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal
  suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their
  pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
  granted more favorable terms.
      USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
  EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
  delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
  from the Iran arms affair.
