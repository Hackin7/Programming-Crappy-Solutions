# Cyberthon 2020 Training
[Cyberthon 2020 ](https://www.cyberthon.hci.edu.sg/) 

"Cyberthon is organised by Hwa Chong Institution (College Section), in collaboration with Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO) and Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT) providing technical expertise. It is a cybersecurity competition that aims to enthuse and inspire students to develop crucial skills relating to Infocomm Technology. The competition is designed to be a skill-appropriate competition for students studying in the equivalent of Junior College/Centralised Institute Year 1 to Year 3.

Through this competition, students will gain a deeper understanding of real-life cyber security issues as well as opportunities to pit their cybersecurity skills against the best in their age group. In the long term, we hope that the competition can help to identify and nurture a core group of Infocomm talents with deep expertise in cyber defence."
