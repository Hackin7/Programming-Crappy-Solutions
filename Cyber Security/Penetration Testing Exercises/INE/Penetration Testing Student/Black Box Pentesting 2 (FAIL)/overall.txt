First, scan the netwrok and machines

## 81
dirb, found a directory /webapp/
Added virtualhost cms.foocorp.io, made the page appear normally
 
tried projectsend metasploit, didn't work
sqlmap also failed

## 91

Has a redis server (only finding it very late), but needs authentication

## 92

dirb, found directories /assets/ and more
read the source code of 1 of the js files,
```
xhr.open("GET", "http://127.0.0.1/72ab311dcbfaa40ca0739f5daf505494/tracking2.php", true);
xhr.send("ua=" + navigator.userAgent + "&platform=" + navigator.platform);
```
Accessed the directory http://172.16.64.92/72ab311dcbfaa40ca0739f5daf505494 which didn't give 404
dirb the directory, found http://172.16.64.92/72ab311dcbfaa40ca0739f5daf505494/login
  - sqlmap it didn't give results
  
Also guessed the directory http://172.16.64.92/72ab311dcbfaa40ca0739f5daf505494/tracking.php from http://172.16.64.92/72ab311dcbfaa40ca0739f5daf505494/tracking2.php
  - sqlmap it gave a database dump
  - From the data, can crack password hashes of login as tracking1:12345 and tracking2:123456, and access panel.php, but no access to console
    when login to tracking 1 or 2 and access tracking2.php, can load but get NULL NULL
    If you add parameters `ua` and `platform`, it replaces the NULL
        - Source code of panel.php shows comment `<!-- = '127.0.0.1'; = 'dbuser'; = 'xXxyYyzZz789789)))'; = 'footracking'; = mysqli_connect(, , , );-->
        - https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_mysqli_connect.asp`
  - From the data 172.16.64.67, 172.16.64.78 and 172.16.64.55 accessed the site in 2019
  
Arp poisoning to intercept connection, but no interception of traffic seen
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
arpspoof -i tap0 -t 172.16.64.92 -r 172.16.64.67 &
arpspoof -i tap0 -t 172.16.64.92 -r 172.16.64.78 &

pkill arpspoof

# Gave up and referred to answers

On referring to the 1st part of the ans, turns out I need to enum harder
 - Need more through nmap scan
 
 Referred to answers, just followed the guide 
  - Important thing is can enum SSH BANNER!!!
  
Got hint to look at hosts.bak
 - Inspiration to add static.foocorp.io to /etc/hosts from hosts.bak
 
 Got a website, which I then enumerated on
 ## 81  
 
 I really just gave up and looked at he guide
 
 # Learning Points
 
 - Burp Suite for looking through all the requests/ responses
 - mysql don't just connect to database directly, enum the databases too
 - SSH Banner
 - php shell
