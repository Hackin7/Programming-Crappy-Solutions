Detected Plugins:
[ Apache ]
	The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and
	maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating
	systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this
	project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible
	server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current
	HTTP standards.

	Version      : 2.4.37 (from HTTP Server Header)
	Google Dorks: (3)
	Website     : http://httpd.apache.org/

[ Bootstrap ]
	Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with
	HTML, CSS, and JS.

	Website     : https://getbootstrap.com/

[ Content-Language ]
	Detect the content-language setting from the HTTP header.

	String       : zh-cn

[ Email ]
	Extract email addresses. Find valid email address and
	syntactically invalid email addresses from mailto: link
	tags. We match syntactically invalid links containing
	mailto: to catch anti-spam email addresses, eg. bob at
	gmail.com. This uses the simplified email regular
	expression from
	http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html for valid
	email address matching.

	String       : webmaster@example.com

[ HTML5 ]
	HTML version 5, detected by the doctype declaration


[ HTTPServer ]
	HTTP server header string. This plugin also attempts to
	identify the operating system from the server header.

	OS           : CentOS
	String       : Apache/2.4.37 (centos) (from server string)

[ PoweredBy ]
	This plugin identifies instances of 'Powered by x' text and
	attempts to extract the value for x.

	String       : Apache,CentOS

[ UncommonHeaders ]
	Uncommon HTTP server headers. The blacklist includes all
	the standard headers and many non standard but common ones.
	Interesting but fairly common headers should have their own
	plugins, eg. x-powered-by, server and x-aspnet-version.
	Info about headers can be found at www.http-stats.com

	String       : tcn (from headers)
