The recycler is a critical piece of our industrial infraestructure.
Please be careful with it!

The .ser file holds all the last data saved from the process, it can
be readed from the upper management dashboard app. 

Remember to set the location of the file to my home directory "~/backups".

Set this directory to share access so the remote system can access the
file via SMB.

Any concerns or suggestions, please reach at samantha@loca.host.
