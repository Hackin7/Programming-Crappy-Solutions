|       OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h
|       does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,
|       which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero
|       length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
|       consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via
|       a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|       Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use anonymous
|       Diffie-Hellman key exchange only provide protection against passive
|       eavesdropping, and are vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attacks
|       which could completely compromise the confidentiality and integrity
|       of any data exchanged over the resulting session.

|   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol DHE_EXPORT Ciphers Downgrade MitM (Logjam)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2015-4000  BID:74733
|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is
|       triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with
|       the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
|       the encrypted stream.

|       Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups
