Detected Plugins:
[ Apache ]
	The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and
	maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating
	systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this
	project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible
	server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current
	HTTP standards.

	Version      : 2.4.41 (from HTTP Server Header)
	Google Dorks: (3)
	Website     : http://httpd.apache.org/

[ Email ]
	Extract email addresses. Find valid email address and
	syntactically invalid email addresses from mailto: link
	tags. We match syntactically invalid links containing
	mailto: to catch anti-spam email addresses, eg. bob at
	gmail.com. This uses the simplified email regular
	expression from
	http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html for valid
	email address matching.
