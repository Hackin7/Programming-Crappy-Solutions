# Scratching the Surface - Challenge 1

### Description

## Solution

At first I opened the file1.wav in Audacity, to notice that the Left and Right audio channels are quite different.
Moreover, the Right Track sounded and looked awfully like Morse Code.

The Steps I took to extract the audio morse code track (from `code.wav`) in Audactiy are
1. Split Stereo Track to Mono (under the file1 dropdown)
2. Delete the track with music
3. Effect -> Normalise, Make the code as loud as possible.

Afterwards, I used an online audio morse code decoder ([here](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)) to get the message.
