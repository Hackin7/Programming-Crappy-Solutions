# Sieberrsec CTF 1.0 Training Challenges

## Event Details

These are Training Challenges from Sieberrsec CTF 1.0 to prepare us for the 2021 Sieberrsec CTF 2.0 which I think were released on 1st Jan 2021?
I was busy preparing for National Service (Conscription) and University Early Admissions, but I took out some time to try some challenges for fun.

## Challenges

Here are the main challenges I did (or helped out with in order). Just traverse the directories to find them
1. `Calculator Evaluation`
1. `Special Stego I - 3D Room`
1. `Calculator Revaluation`

## Others' Writeups

I'll post them here if I find any when I can (I may be in camp by this time lol)
