# ångstromCTF


## Event Details

This is a ctf that exists and that I found on CTF Time. I'll probably never properly fill up this yet.
Either Way I did some Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering Practice (Though that was too basic).
I learnt how to use z3 and learnt something new so thats a win. However, I was too lazy and dumb to be able to do any of the other pwn challenges.

I participated in it on 3rd to 7th April 2021 with [undefined_func](https://github.com/undefined-func)

We did a decent number of challenges and scored decent I think.
