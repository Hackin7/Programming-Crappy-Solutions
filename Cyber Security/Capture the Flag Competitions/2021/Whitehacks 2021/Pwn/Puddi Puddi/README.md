```
$ checksec puddi

After reading the code, I thought it is a typical buffer overflow problem, to overflow the variable such that you modify the other variables on the stack.

So this is what I did (or what I think I did my brain dead)
1. I decompiled the code, and figured out it is comparing a target variable with the string `GIGA`
2. Get the size of the stack using the gdb command `print $rbp-$rsp`. $rbp is the base pointer, $rsp is the stack pointer. I set a hook to keep printing the stack
3. I used this [amazing tool](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/) to generate a buffer overflow pattern. After that I read the stack and see the data in the memory location of the target variable. Putting the data in the tool again gives me the offset
4. Replace the appropriate data in the string with the string `GIGA`
