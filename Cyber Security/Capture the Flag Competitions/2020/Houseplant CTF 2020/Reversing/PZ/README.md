Ok, I think I made it slightly better. Now you won't get the flag this time!

# Solution
Just by reading the code, you know in the main function, `access = catcheckpass()`.

In `catcheckpass()`, 
```
def catcheckpass():
  userinput = input("pwease enter youwr password... uwu~ nya!!: ")
  if userinput == "rtcp{iT5_s1mPlY_1n_tH3_C0d3}":
      return True
  else:
      return False
```

# Flag 
`rtcp{iT5_s1mPlY_1n_tH3_C0d3}`
