# Defence Science and Technology Agency Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp (DSTA CDDC) 2020

Organised by the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp (CDDC) returns for its eighth edition, as part of the BrainHack experience!

If you are curious about cyber defence, or looking for a fun and exciting way to level up your cyber skills, mark your calendars for CDDC 2020 from 3 to 5 July!

Pick up and practise fundamental cybersecurity techniques through our online training programme from 8 to 28 June to get up to speed. Face off against fellow enthusiasts and clear team challenges in an online Capture-The-Flag competition! Top teams stand to win attractive prizes.

The camp consists of two categories: students in local junior colleges / Integrated Programme schools (Year 5 and 6) / Institutes of Technical Education; and full-time students in universities (undergraduates) / polytechnics.


## Event details

I felt that the challenges were a bit guessy, for example, in How QueeR you had to google about the kind of barcode, for ilovedes you had to guess the key. Also I wanted to do the Pwn challenges but wasn't skilled enough to do so. It wasn't that bad (Hey I did more challenges than in Cyberthon) but it could definitely have been better.

**Here are some challenges I done:**

Warp Gate 5
1. [RE (Windows)-1] Decompile Me
2. [RE (Windows)-2] Dissect Me
3. [Misc-2] ARGH
