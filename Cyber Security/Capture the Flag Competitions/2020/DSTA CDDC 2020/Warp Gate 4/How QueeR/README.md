# Solution

I actually didn't know how to do this challenge at the start. My guess was that it was a stegonography challenge or something similar but `zsteg` or `gimp` or  `binwalk` didn't get anything

One of my friends gave me a suggestion that it was a kind of barcode. Doing some googling, I got this [website](https://support.idautomation.com/2D-Barcode-Fonts/A-list-of-2D-Barcode-Types/_2694). It showed that there was a file format called MAXICODE which looked very similar to the image.

Firstly I converted it into a `.png` file using an online converter. After that, to make it look more like a MAXICODE Barcode, I inverted the image using an [online tool](https://pinetools.com/invert-image-colors)

After that I used an [online decoder](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) to decode the image.
