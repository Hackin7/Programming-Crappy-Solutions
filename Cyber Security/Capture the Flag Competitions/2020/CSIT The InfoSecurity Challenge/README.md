## Event Details

I started my session at around 9pm, 9/8/2020. I ended up spending way too much time idling, setting things up and not being able to progress (especially on STAGE 2). I gave up about 24 hours in, as I had other work to do (like School). Nevertheless, I still learnt some things, such as practicing how to identify encoding/compression types, UPX Packing Golang, Reverse Engineering using Cutter.

I do not guarantee that the flags I have would be suitable for your submission, nor do I encourage anyone to steal my flags and submit them without understanding of how to get the flag. These writeups are mainly for archival records and for learning purposes

## My Stuff

I only could do 2 challenges
1. STAGE 0 (Test Stage): Introduction
    * Do the survey to get the flag `TISC20{finished_the_form_973926492}`
2. STAGE 1: What is this thing
    * I took 6 hours or so.

I tried to do STAGE 2 and even got a RSA Key, but for some reason it didn't work (probably it was the incorrect one)
