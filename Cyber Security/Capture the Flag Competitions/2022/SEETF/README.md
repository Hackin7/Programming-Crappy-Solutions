# SEETF

Over the weekend, I participated in the [SEETF](https://ctftime.org/event/1543) Capture The Flag Competition. My Team was NYCP, and we ended up doing average, or even below average, at 114th place out of 740 teams (560 teams got >200 points)

Overall this was an interesting CTF. Some of the challenges had very interesting concepts, like the Weird Machines one (though I was too lazy and not good enough to solve them). Even the beginner challenges were well thought out, with useful resources included **AND** applying them in interesting enough ways.

I'll be going through some of the challenges that I focused on. I aim to go through it in detail for any beginners/n00bs (like myself lol). Basic Linux/ Python/ Web Programming knowledge is assumed.
