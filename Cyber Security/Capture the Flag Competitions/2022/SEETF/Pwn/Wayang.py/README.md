# Wayang.py

## Solution

This is a simple command injection challenge that was satisfying to work through.

These are the contents of wayang.py that were given

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python

FLAG_FILE = "FLAG"

        not_allowed = [char for char in FLAG_FILE]

        for char in filename:

                os.system(f"cat news.txt")

        print("NOT READY YET. MAYBE AFTER CTF????")
```

This line in option 4 in particular looks like injection can be done, eiither through `eval` or command line injection.
- `eval` is a python function that evaluates its argument as python code. In other words, we could potentially custom inject some python code.
- `eval(filename)` is injected into the command through an f-string. This means that I could do a command injection to run Linux Commands.

```
os.system(f"cat {eval(filename)}")
```


The variable `filename` just needs to contain characters which are not in the variable `not_allowed`. They are `FLAG`. As such, we are free to use characters like `;`, to chain togther linux commands.

My eventual payload decided on was `"1+1;cat *"`. 
- The quotes are to denote that the input parsed by `eval` is a python string. 
- `1+1` is just some padding for the `cat` in `f"cat {eval(filename)}"` to parse. `cat 1+1` would actually result in an error in the linux terminal, but I don't really care if other useless systems crash and burn :)
- `;` is a command delimiter. This means that
- `cat *` displays all the contents of all the files in the directory, where `cat` shows the contents of file, and `*` refers to all files in the directory. This would most likely include the flag file.
