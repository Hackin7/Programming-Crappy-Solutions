# STACK the Flags 2022

STACK the Flags is a 48-hour, online jeopardy style Capture-the-Flag competition organised by GovTechâ€™s Cyber Security Group.

Participants will get to compete and test their cybersecurity skills in challenges across 11 different cybersecurity domains.

The categories are:

-   Binary Exploitation
-   Cloud
-   Cryptography
-   Forensics
-   Internet of things (IoT)
-   Miscellaneous
-   Mobile
-   Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
-   Reverse Engineering (RE)
-   Fullpwn
-   Web

## Event Details

I participated it on 2-4 Dec with undefined-func and Codekrodile. Overall my 1st CTF in a long time, and good that I easily finished 4 Web challenges in the first 6 hours, and the remaining 3 challenges took 4 hours or so. However, I was stuck on the other challenges.

Overall I think our performance is ok. PortSwigger labs really helped with the Web Challenges. However, there's room to improve my methodology, as some of the challenges I felt I could have done. Time to grind!

Now that I think about it probably should have went Category 2 to aim for a higher rank lmao.
