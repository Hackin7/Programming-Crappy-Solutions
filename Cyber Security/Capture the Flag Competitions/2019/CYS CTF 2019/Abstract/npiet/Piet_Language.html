<H2>Introduction</H2>Piet is a programming language in which programs look like 
abstract paintings. The language is named after <A 
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/mondrian/">Piet Mondrian</A>, who 
pioneered the field of geometric abstract art. I would have liked to call the 
language Mondrian, but <A 
href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~erik/Mondrian/Description.html">someone beat me to 
it</A> with a rather mundane-looking scripting language. Oh well, we can't all 
be esoteric language writers I suppose.

      color=#ffffff>#000000&nbsp;black</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Piet uses 20 
distinct colours, as shown in the table at right. The 18 colours in the first 3 
rows of the table are related cyclically in the following two ways: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Hue Cycle:</B> red -&gt; yellow -&gt; green -&gt; cyan -&gt; blue -&gt; 
  magenta -&gt; red 
  <LI><B>Lightness Cycle:</B> light -&gt; normal -&gt; dark -&gt; light 
</LI></UL>Note that "light" is considered to be one step "darker" than "dark", 
and vice versa. White and black do not fall into either cycle. 
<P>Additional colours (such as orange, brown) may be used, though their effect 
is implementation-dependent. In the simplest case, non-standard colours are 
treated by the language interpreter as the same as white, so may be used freely 
wherever white is used. (Another possibility is that they are treated the same 
as black.) 
<H3>Codels</H3>Piet code takes the form of graphics made up of the recognised 
colours. Individual pixels of colour are significant in the language, so it is 
common for programs to be enlarged for viewing so that the details are easily 
visible. In such enlarged programs, the term "codel" is used to mean a block of 
colour equivalent to a single pixel of code, to avoid confusion with the actual 
pixels of the enlarged graphic, of which many may make up one codel. 
<H3>Colour Blocks</H3>The basic unit of Piet code is the colour block. A colour 
block is a contiguous block of any number of codels of one colour, bounded by 
blocks of other colours or by the edge of the program graphic. Blocks of colour 
adjacent only diagonally are not considered contiguous. A colour block may be 
any shape and may have "holes" of other colours inside it, which are not 
considered part of the block. 
<H3>Stack</H3>Piet uses a stack for storage of all data values. Data values 
exist only as integers, though they may be read in or printed as Unicode 
character values with appropriate commands.

    <TD>rightmost</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The Piet language interpreter begins 
executing a program in the colour block which includes the upper left codel of 
the program. The interpreter maintains a <EM>Direction Pointer</EM> (DP), 
initially pointing to the right. The DP may point either right, left, down or 
up. The interpreter also maintains a <EM>Codel Chooser</EM> (CC), initially 
pointing left. The CC may point either left or right. The directions of the DP 
and CC will often change during program execution. 
<P>As it executes the program, the interpreter traverses the colour blocks of 
the program under the following rules: 
<OL>
  <LI>The interpreter finds the edge of the current colour block which is 
  furthest in the direction of the DP. (This edge may be disjoint if the block 
  is of a complex shape.) 
  <LI>The interpreter finds the codel of the current colour block on that edge 
  which is furthest to the CC's direction of the DP's direction of travel. 
  (Visualise this as standing on the program and walking in the direction of the 
  DP; see table at right.) 
  <LI>The interpreter travels from that codel into the colour block containing 
  the codel immediately in the direction of the DP. </LI></OL>The interpreter 
continues doing this until the program terminates. 
<H2>Syntax Elements</H2>
<H3>Numbers</H3>Each non-black, non-white colour block in a Piet program 
represents an integer equal to the number of codels in that block. Note that 
non-positive integers cannot be represented, although they can be constructed 
with operators. When the interpreter encounters a number, it does not 
necessarily do anything with it. In particular, it is not automatically pushed 
on to the stack - there is an explicit command for that (see below). 
<H3>Black Blocks and Edges</H3>Black colour blocks and the edges of the program 
restrict program flow. If the Piet interpreter attempts to move into a black 
block or off an edge, it is stopped and the CC is toggled. The interpreter then 
attempts to move from its current block again. If it fails a second time, the DP 
is moved clockwise one step. These attempts are repeated, with the CC and DP 
being changed between alternate attempts. If after eight attempts the 
interpreter cannot leave its current colour block, there is no way out and the 
program terminates. 
<H3>White Blocks</H3>White colour blocks are "free" zones through which the 
interpreter passes unhindered. If it moves from a colour block into a white 
area, the interpreter "slides" through the white codels in the direction of the 
DP until it reaches a non-white colour block. If the interpreter slides into a 
black block or an edge, it is considered restricted (see above), otherwise it 
moves into the colour block so encountered. Sliding across white blocks does not 
cause a command to be executed (see below).

colour from one colour block to the next as the interpreter travels through the 
program. The number of steps along the Hue Cycle and Lightness Cycle in each 
transition determine the command executed, as shown in the table at right. If 
the transition between colour blocks occurs via a slide across a white block, no 
command is executed. The individual commands are explained below. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>push:</B> Pushes the value of the colour block just exited on to the 
  stack. Note that values of colour blocks are not automatically pushed on to 
  the stack - this push operation must be explicitly carried out. 
  <LI><B>pop:</B> Pops the top value off the stack and discards it. 
  <LI><B>add:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, adds them, and pushes 
  the result back on the stack. 
  <LI><B>subtract:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, subtracts the top 
  value from the second top value, and pushes the result back on the stack. 
  <LI><B>multiply:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, multiplies them, 
  and pushes the result back on the stack. 
  <LI><B>divide:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, calculates the 
  integer division of the second top value by the top value, and pushes the 
  result back on the stack. 
  <LI><B>mod:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, calculates the second 
  top value modulo the top value, and pushes the result back on the stack. 
  <LI><B>not:</B> Replaces the top value of the stack with 0 if it is non-zero, 
  and 1 if it is zero. 
  <LI><B>greater:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack, and pushes 1 on to 
  the stack if the second top value is greater than the top value, and pushes 0 
  if it is not greater. 
  <LI><B>pointer:</B> Pops the top value off the stack and rotates the DP 
  clockwise that many steps (anticlockwise if negative). 
  <LI><B>switch:</B> Pops the top value off the stack and toggles the CC that 
  many times. 
  <LI><B>duplicate:</B> Pushes a copy of the top value on the stack on to the 
  stack. 
  <LI><B>roll:</B> Pops the top two values off the stack and "rolls" the 
  remaining stack entries to a depth equal to the second value popped, by a 
  number of rolls equal to the first value popped. A single roll to depth 
  <I>n</I> is defined as burying the top value on the stack <I>n</I> deep and 
  bringing all values above it up by 1 place. A negative number of rolls rolls 
  in the opposite direction. A negative depth is an error and the command is 
  ignored. 
  <LI><B>in:</B> Reads a value from STDIN as either a number or character, 
  depending on the particular incarnation of this command and pushes it on to 
  the stack. 
  <LI><B>out:</B> Pops the top value off the stack and prints it to STDOUT as 
  either a number or character, depending on the particular incarnation of this 
  command. </LI></UL>Any operations which cannot be performed (such as popping 
values when not enough are on the stack) are simply ignored. <IMG height=145

<H2>Sample Programs</H2>
<H3>Hello World</H3><IMG height=29 hspace=10 
src="Piet_Language-Dateien/Piet_hello.png" width=30 align=right> This program 
prints "Hello world!" and then exits. It is shown in two sizes: 1 pixel per 
codel, and 25 pixels per codel. Program flow proceeds clockwise from the upper 
left red block along the edge of the program until the dark blue block at lower 
left is reached. It then proceeds up to the single light blue codel, right to 
the dark cyan codel, and right into the large green block at centre. From there 
it flows left through the dark green codel to the yellow block, then up through 
the dark yellow codel to the red block inside the black codels, where execution 
halts. This produces the required ASCII codes in a brute force manner, with each 
of the large blocks coding one of the required characters, but there are a few 
stack tricks in there to prevent having to redefine the same character more than 
once. (Thanks to Matt Rudary for debugging!) 
<H3>Fibonacci Numbers</H3><IMG height=121 hspace=10 
src="Piet_Language-Dateien/fibbig1.gif" width=110 align=right> <IMG height=121 
hspace=10 src="Piet_Language-Dateien/fibbig.gif" width=110 align=right> <IMG 
height=11 hspace=10 src="Piet_Language-Dateien/fib.gif" width=10 align=right> 
This program prints the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. It is shown at 1 pixel per 
codel, and twice at 121 pixels per codel. The second copy of the large version 
is overlaid with a black line to show program flow, beginning at the upper left. 
The flow sets up initial stack entries and prints the first two numbers before 
entering a loop at the dark blue codel in the centre of the left edge. The loop 
executes clockwise, rejoining itself at the dark blue codel. The branch in the 
long green block at the bottom is the test to see whether the 100th number has 
been printed. If it has, the code branches up to the red block and terminates 
there. Note that the yellow-&gt;dark blue transition on both entry points to the 
loop are "pointer" commands defining rotations of the DP, necessary to get the 
DP pointing in the right direction to trace the loop. Non-significant codels are 
left white to emphasise readability of the code, but in practice these could be 
filled with other colours for greater artistic effect. The only significant 
white codel is the slide from dark blue to yellow just before rejoining the 
loop, required to get the yellow to dark blue transition for the "pointer" 
command. 
<H3>Towers of Hanoi</H3><IMG height=126 hspace=10 
src="Piet_Language-Dateien/hanoibig.gif" width=216 align=right> <IMG height=14 
hspace=10 src="Piet_Language-Dateien/hanoi.gif" width=24 align=right> This 
program solves the Towers of Hanoi problem. It was written by Sylvain 
Tintillier. Don't ask me how it works, I have no idea! <BR clear=all>
<H3>Fancy Hello World</H3><IMG height=176 hspace=10 
src="Piet_Language-Dateien/Piet_hello2_big.png" width=176 align=right> <IMG 
height=16 hspace=10 src="Piet_Language-Dateien/Piet_hello2.png" width=16 
align=right> To show you how different two programs that do the same thing can 
look, this is another version of "Hello World!" written by Matt Rudary. I'm not 
sure how it works, but it looks a lot more elegant than my version. <BR
