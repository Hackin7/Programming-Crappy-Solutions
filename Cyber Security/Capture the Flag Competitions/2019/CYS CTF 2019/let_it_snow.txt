Oh, the weather outside is frightful	      		    		       
But the fire is so delightful	     	     	       	   	   	    
And since we've no place to go    	   	       	       	   
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow	  	       	       	    
	       	   	       	  	     	  	      	 	      
Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'       	      	      		  
And I brought me some corn for poppin'	      	    	       	       
The lights are turned way down low	    	     	      	    
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow	   	  	 	     	     
  	  	       
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
